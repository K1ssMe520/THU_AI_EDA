Please help me generate a floating-point multiplier unit, including RTL code and TestBench. 

The start code of the module is as follows. 

When responsing, please fill in RTL and TestBench respectively in the code box starting with "### RTL" and "### TestBench" as shown below.

### RTL
```verilog
module fp_multiplier
(
    input wire clk,
    input wire rst_n,
    input wire [xx:0] A,
    input wire [xx:0] B,
    output wire [xx:0] C,
    ...
)
...
endmodule
```

### TestBench
```systemverilog
module fp_multiplier_tb;
...
endmodule
```
